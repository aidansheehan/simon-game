# simon-game

## Description
I built a 'Simon' style memory game using jQuery to track and respond to user interactions with the document object model.
Players must remember and reproduce a colour pattern, with an extra colour added on each iteration. This project was built as part of a challenge from 
'The Complete Web Development Bootcamp' (London App Brewery) and takes its styling from the initial files for this challenge.
